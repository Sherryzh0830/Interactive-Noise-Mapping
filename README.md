# Interactive-Noise-Mapping

Objective: The objective of this noise mapping platform is to furnish reliable and actionable acoustic data that architects, urban planners, and local residents can utilize. Our aim is to present a clear picture of the ambient noise levels within the region in question. By doing so, we intend to empower stakeholders with the necessary insights to make informed decisions regarding urban design, residential development, and community living spaces. The platform is not just a repository of information but a tool for enhancing the quality of life by mitigating noise pollution through strategic planning and design.
